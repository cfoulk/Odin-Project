## Introduction
Odin is a project management software designed for use by small technical businesses to help organize their work towards large goals. It's leadership based structure allows for different responsibilities to be held by different workers. Managers organize the Project Leads who manage the employees. Managers create, delete, and define projects. Project leads give tasks to employees to work towards the project. Employees log their work through starting, stopping, and describing.

## Product Reviews
Basecamp is a business management tool used to keep company projects organized and employees informed. It utilizes message boards and project pages to keep work organized and communicative. The software can be used for scheduling, sharing workloads, chatting, file sharing, and work logging. All work is divided into different teams and projects. Remember The Milk is a much more personal task management software that is meant for families to keep track of everyone's responsibilities. It includes the ability to add tasks through single lines that define everything from the name, to what it is, to a due date, and a priority size. It reminds the user of their tasks through a computer using IM and email, or a phone through texting and push apps. Each task can be broken up into smaller subtasks and lists of tasks can be shared with others using the app. Producteev is another group project manager with useful tools for keeping a project rolling. Deadlines, reminders, priorities, tags, labels, and following all help keep the project participants knowledgeable of the work their peers are doing. In addition, team members can assign each other tasks to give everyone an idea of what they should be doing in the project. Asana separates itself from other project management tools by being one of the most visual ones we could find.

## Project Overview
From our research on various project management tools we will be using a couple of ideas. First, our present Task Management software has no way of recognizing when a task is finished, so we will be adding support for finished tasks as well as due dates for the tasks. In addition, projects without priorities lack structure and guidance, so we will be adding priorities to our tasks. As a project is composed of many tasks, a progression check for how close a project is to completion will be added. We will be also adding support for logging in under different users to keep track of everyone's participation separately as well as keeping the responsibilities in line.Finally, we will be adding a GUI to make the product more suitable for general use by non computer specialists.
